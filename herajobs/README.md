# Hera Health Solutions Job Application Tracker

A modern job application tracking system built with Vite, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## ðŸ”’ Security Setup

### Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to keep sensitive information secure. 

1. **Copy the example environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update `.env` with your actual values:**
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-actual-supabase-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key
   VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
   ```

3. **Never commit `.env` to git** - it's already in `.gitignore`

### For Deployment

When deploying to Render, Vercel, or other platforms:

1. Set environment variables in your hosting platform's dashboard
2. Use the same variable names as in `.env.example`
3. The app will automatically use these values
