            <h4 style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Our Story</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Hera Health Solutions began with a question: why are long-term drug treatments still painful, expensive, and inefficient for millions of patients? After traveling across the U.S. and listening to both patients and doctors, we uncovered a major challenge—ensuring continuous medication delivery without the burdens of daily pills or invasive procedures.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Our Background</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">This insight led our team—biomedical engineers from the Georgia Institute of Technology—to develop a better solution. We set out to create a long-acting drug delivery system that is easy to use, effective, and eliminates the need for painful implant removal procedures.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The Problem We're Solving</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Today, millions rely on subcutaneous arm implants to receive hormonal or therapeutic treatments. But once these implants expire, they must be surgically removed—a process that can be costly, painful, and lead to scarring or other complications. Some patients even require full operations.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Our Breakthrough Solution</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Our biodegradable, patent-pending drug delivery implants naturally dissolve in the body over time, eliminating the need for removal altogether. This innovation not only reduces cost and risk—it also improves patient experience by simplifying treatment regimens.</p>
